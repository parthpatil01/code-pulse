## ðŸš€ Key Technical Architecture

âœ… **Scalable on AWS**: Leverages the power of Amazon Web Services (AWS) with services like EC2, Docker, and Auto Scaling to ensure high availability and the ability to handle increasing user loads.

âœ… **Intelligent Refactoring**: Implements Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) combined with OpenAI models to provide intelligent code refactoring suggestions and improvements.

âœ… **Vector DB for Knowledge**: Utilizes Pinecone, a vector database, to store and retrieve information relevant to code understanding and refactoring.

âœ… **Serverless Workflows**: Employs AWS Lambda functions for efficient and cost-effective backend operations and event-driven workflows.

âœ… **Decoupled Async Tasks**: Uses AWS Simple Queue Service (SQS) to decouple components and manage asynchronous code execution tasks reliably.

âœ… **Secure Storage**: Ensures the security and durability of code submissions and metadata using AWS Simple Storage Service (S3) and Relational Database Service (RDS).

âœ… **Monitoring**: Implements comprehensive monitoring and logging using AWS CloudWatch to track application performance and identify potential issues.

âœ… **Managed API**: Provides a secure, scalable, and easily manageable API endpoint using AWS API Gateway.

âœ… **Containerized**: Leverages Docker containers to provide isolated and consistent execution environments for user code.

âœ… **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Defines and manages the entire AWS infrastructure using Terraform, ensuring consistency and repeatability.

- **Docker**: For creating isolated and consistent environments for code execution.

### Backend
- **Node.js**: For server-side logic and handling API requests.
- **AWS SDK**: For seamless interaction with various AWS services (S3, SQS, RDS, Lambda).
- **MySQL**: For storing application metadata and submission statuses.
- **OpenAI**: For integration with intelligent code refactoring features.
- **Pinecone**: As a vector database for storing and querying code embeddings.

### Frontend
- **React**: For building a dynamic and interactive user interface.
- **Monaco Editor**: A powerful code editor component with syntax highlighting and advanced editing features.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid and responsive styling.
- **Vite**: A fast development server and build tool for modern web applications.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js** (v18 or higher)
- **Docker** (latest version)
- **AWS Account** with access to S3, SQS, RDS, Lambda, and API Gateway
- **Terraform** (for infrastructure setup)
- **OpenAI API Key**: Required for utilizing intelligent refactoring features.
- **Pinecone API Key**: Required for interacting with the Pinecone vector database.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/parthpatil01/code-pulse.git
   cd code-pulse
   ```

2. Set up the infrastructure using Terraform:
   ```bash
   cd terraform
   terraform init
   terraform apply
   ```

3. Configure environment variables:
   - Create a `.env` file in the `ec2-setup` directory with the following:
     ```env
     AWS_REGION=us-east-1
     S3_BUCKET_NAME=your-s3-bucket-name
     SQS_QUEUE_URL=your-sqs-queue-url
     DB_HOST=your-rds-endpoint
     DB_USER=your-db-username
     DB_PASSWORD=your-db-password
     DB_NAME=your-db-name
     ```

4. Start the backend services:
   ```bash
   cd backend/submit-code
   npm install
   zip -r function-submit.zip .
   # Zip the rest of the lambda files e.g status, refactor
   ```

5. Start the frontend:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

6. Access the application at `http://ec2-ip` or `https://api-gateway-url`.

## Usage

1. **Write Code**: Use the Monaco Editor to write code in your preferred language.
2. **Run Code**: Click the "Run" button to submit your code for execution. The request is queued using SQS and processed by an EC2 worker in isolated docker environment.
3. **Intelligent Refactoring**: Select code in the editor and trigger the refactoring feature. Suggestions powered by RAG and OpenAI will be displayed.
4. **View Output**: The real-time output and status updates are displayed in the "Output" tab, fetched via the backend API.
5. **Manage Files**: Create, save, import, export, or delete files using the file explorer.
6. **Customize Settings**: Open the settings modal to adjust editor preferences like font size, word wrap, and tab size.
